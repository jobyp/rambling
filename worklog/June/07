Local build issue resolved (git in Ubuntu 13.04 doesn't play well with
guilt).
Built kernel-dom0 for EA-1112.

CA-96634: sles111/TCMultipleVDI: SSH command exited with error (mkfs.ext2 /dev/xvdg)
Most likely invalid. Couldn't reproduce with the latest EA-1112 build.
Need to check with David Vrabel before closing this.

CA-104275: Basic installation of Debian Squeeze works.
Need to extract a better repro procedure from the test.
Need to look at debian-installer.

Tommorrow
